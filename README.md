# snapshot
Command line tool to snapshot a directory as a .zip file with relative paths. Written in Go.

This is a very simple command line tool written in Go that snapshots a directory as a .zip file with relative embedded paths, so it can later be retrieved as a whole. It doesn't aim at preserving file permissions and ownership.

## TODO

Future versions are planned to support unzipping and also the storing of meta information, to turn this into a simple archiving tool for project directories.
